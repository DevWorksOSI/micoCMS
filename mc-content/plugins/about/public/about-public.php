      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>microCMS is essentially software that was written for the blogger and small business, but it works for everyone. We believe great software should work with minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>microCMS started it's journey as a web based employee collaboartion platform in 2007 and it found itself on Github one year later with major changes to the code base in order to implement blogs, pages and such. Since then, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) became a standard in the Web Dev Community, in 2018 we began turning the core upside down and turning to class based system. Currently we are re writing many things in order to get them compliant and up to par with current standards.</p>
